# Grading Rubric for Assignment #1

Please include your name at the top of the submitted notebook.

**Important:** Your notebooks should be a polished finished product.

- Please be sure that your name (as well as the names of anyone you worked with) is listed at the top of the notebook file you submit.
- Please remove any extra or unneccesary code.
- When possible, use markdown cells for comments or add comments directly to your Python code to help explain the steps in your analysis.
- Section headers in markdown can also be helpful to mark different sections of the analysis.

- Notebook files should be reproducible and executable.
- Ensure that your assignments can be executed from top to bottom and produce the desired result. This is how our course TAs will grade each assignment.
- If your analysis loads a dataset, make sure you either A) Add the dataset to the repository, or B) document the original source of the data so it can be downloaded during grading.
- Make sure you are using relative file paths when loading your data so that the TA can download your repository and the file structure will still work. For more information, check out the guide on file paths.
